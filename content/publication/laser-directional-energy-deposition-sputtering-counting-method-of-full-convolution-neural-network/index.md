abstract: "The invention provides a laser directional energy deposition
  sputtering counting method of a full convolution neural network. Collecting
  laser directional energy deposition images, finding all contours in each image
  by using a topological structure analysis method, establishing a minimum
  rectangular frame for the contours, segmenting the images in the minimum
  rectangular frame, labeling labels, and constructing a training set; building
  a full convolution neural network, inputting the image and the label into the
  network for prediction, building a loss function and training to a Nash
  equilibrium state optimization network; collecting images to be detected,
  carrying out morphological processing, finding the outline of each image by
  using a topological structure analysis method, establishing a minimum
  rectangular frame, segmenting the image in the minimum rectangular frame, and
  inputting network prediction: if sputtering is carried out, the pixel is
  reserved; otherwise, setting the color as black; and (3) carrying out graying
  and gradient pixel processing on the image, finding the outline by adopting a
  watershed algorithm, and counting the number of the outlines to obtain the
  sputtering number. The invention identifies and counts the sputtering in the
  laser directional energy deposition process, and is beneficial to the
  regulation and control of the manufacturing process."

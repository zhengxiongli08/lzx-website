abstract: In digital filter design, efficient resource utilization is a hot
  topic. Due to linear phase characteristics of FIR filters, a pulsed fully
  parallel structure can be adopted. In order to further reduce hardware
  consumption especially caused by multiplication function, an improved RAG
  algorithm is proposed. Filters with different orders and for different
  algorithms are compared, and the experimental results show that the improved
  RAG algorithm is excellent in terms of logic resource utilization, resource
  allocation, running speed, and power consumption for different application
  scenarios. The algorithm invokes a better circuit structure for FIR filter, it
  gives full play to resource allocation strategy and reduces logic resource
  consumption. The proposed circuit is faster and more stable, and suitable for
  a variety of complex application scenarios.

abstract: The invention provides a method for calculating the laser directional
  energy deposition area of a full convolution neural network. The method
  comprises the steps of collecting a plurality of laser directional energy
  deposition area images, manually marking each molten pool label, and further
  constructing a training set; building a full convolution neural network,
  inputting the images in the training set into the neural network, predicting
  the existing value of a molten pool, further combining with the marked
  construction loss function, and optimizing to Nash balance to obtain the
  optimized neural network; collecting an image to be detected, inputting the
  image into an optimized neural network, and judging whether the image has a
  molten pool area; if the molten pool exists, graying the image to obtain a
  gray level image, and further carrying out binarization to obtain a binary
  image; and (4) obtaining a molten pool contour pixel coordinate set of the
  image by a topological structure analysis method for the binary image, and
  further calculating the area of the molten pool. The invention can identify
  the molten pool in the laser directional energy deposition process and
  calculate the area of the molten pool, and is beneficial to the regulation and
  control of the manufacturing process.
